  "Rust’s design has taken inspiration from many existing languages and techniques, and one significant influence is functional programming. Programming in a functional style often includes using functions as values by passing them in arguments, returning them from other functions, assigning them to variables for later execution, and so forth.": {
    "_translate": "Rust 的设计受到了许多现有语言和技术的启发，其中一个重要的影响是 <em>函数式编程</em>。以函数式风格编程通常包括将函数用作值，通过传递它们作为参数、从其他函数返回它们、将它们分配给变量以供稍后执行等。",
